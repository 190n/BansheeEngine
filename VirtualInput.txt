TODO:
Extend CamelotOIS so it returns a timestamp of each event
 - INputHandlerOIS currently sents timestamp to 0. Make sure to update that.
 - I need to ensure that time value returned from OIS can be compared to time returned from gTime() (In BsVirtualInput::update)

IMPORTANT: Was there an issue with raw input events vs. OS input events?
 - It might not be possible to use raw input events to manage the UI events?
  - Or was the only reason lack of auto-repeat?

 - Change how I handle axes in CmInput
   - Right now there is only single horizontal and single vertical axis, which makes little sense
   - Plus a lot of axis functionality should probably be moved to VirtualInput
 - Register InputConfiguration containing default keys during Editor start-up
