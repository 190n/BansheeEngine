>>>>>>>>>>FINAL SPRINT BEFORE EDITOR WORK
Pass
 - A way to bind buffers to a Pass, while specifying buffer range
 - GpuParams support for buffers, structs
 - Add GL Texture buffers (They're equivalent to DX11 buffers) - http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Buffer_Texture

Shader import:
 - Make sure none of the current shaders in CamelotClient are defined in code anymore
 - Add include files to ImportOptions

Add a better way of determining GLSL cpuMemOffset and block size (seems to be using DX11 padding)
 - I probably need to determine struct sizes before assigning cpuMemOffset
 - I probably also need a preprocessing step to determine array sizes

Deserialization issues:
 - Currently Reflectable is not allowed to hold a ReflectablePtr
   - Because Reflectable might be assigned before a pointer is decoded and assigned, therefore
      ending up with a null pointer. Changing the order when we decode pointers would solve this issue.
 - Changing the order of pointer decoding increases the chance of getting an uninitialized pointer in your RTTI class. 
    e.g. Mesh::setMeshData expects an initialized MeshDataPtr to be provided.

SOLUTION: Decode all pointers ON THE SPOT (whether they are referenced by Reflectable or ReflectablePtr), before we assign them
 - Recusive references remain an issue though
   - Objects referencing themselves are checked during application start-up (or compile time?). User is warned of the situation, 
      and he has so remedy it by making one of the references Weak (a special property assigned to the RTTI field)

Can be delayed:
 - Make sure that I am able to blit contents from render textures on all render systems
 - Once I get DX11 running make sure to test if driver complains about missing shader attributes or invalid size ones
 - Better creation of PrimaryWindow
   - RENDERWINDOWDESC accepts a "externalWindow" flag and an "externalHandle" so when creating the primary window with RenderSystem::initialize we don't always need to create a new window
   - Actually new OpenGL seems to support creating context without a window with the help of wglCreateContextAttribsARB and wglMakeCurrent:
 - Instead of doing setThisPtr on every CoreGpuObject, use intrusive shared_ptr instead?
 - OpenGL render window no longer looks for a monitor index
 - Material RTTI should also serialize shared buffers (they need to be made into a resource)
   - BE CAREFUL on how this will be implemented. Likely it will have much of the same interface as a material and/or GpuParams
 - Mesh::setMeshData is currently always synced
 - queueGpuCommand is handled weird. shared_ptr isn't used for setting (this) parameter, and could be optimized out by the compiler
   - test if everything is okay in release mode
 - Resources::unload will deadlock if the resource isn't being loaded!
   - Maybe re-think how I handle ResourceHandle.isCreated?
 - Check D3D9/D3D11/GL resource usages. DX11 reports many unreleased objects. I'm guessing DX9 will as well. Not sure how to check OpenGL.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>START WORKING ON THE EDITOR!
 

---------------------------------------------------

<<<<Resource changes and reimport>>>>
Use case example:
 - User reimports a .gpuproginc file
   - Dependencies are held by CoreGpuObjectManager. Objects are required to register/unregister
      their dependencies in their methods manually.
 - Editor calls SomeClass::reimport(handle) after it detects a change 
   - this will load a new resource, release the old one and assign the new one to Handle without changing the GUID
   - In order to make it thread safe force all threads to finish what they're doing and pause them until the switch is done
     - Should be okay considering this should only happen in edit-mode so performance isn't imperative
   - reimport is recursively called on all dependant objects as well.

<<<<Handle multithreaded object management>>>:
 - Make everything that is possible immutable. Once created it cant be changed.
  - Example are shaders, state objects and similar
 - Things like Textures, Vertex, Index buffers, GpuParams may be changed
  - Make Vertex/Index buffers and similar only accesible from render thread. Higher level classes like meshes can have deferred methods
  - TODO - How to handle the remaining actually deferred methods? Like Textures?

DirectX11 supports concurrent drawing and resource creation so all my resource updates should be direct calls to DX methods (I'll need a deferred context?)
 - DX9 doesn't so creating/updating resources should wait for render thread?
  - Although these are sync points which kill the whole concept of separate render thread
  - Updating via copy then? (DX11 driver does it internally if resource is used anyway)
 - OpenGL? No idea, need to study GL contexts
 - Although it seems DX11 also copies data when mapping/unmapping or updating on a non-immediate context. So maybe copy is the solution?

So final solution:
 - Copy all data that will be updated on a deferred context
  - Make deferred context have a scratch buffer it can use for storing temporary copied data
 - Immediate context will execute all commands right away
  - This applies when rendering thread calls resource create/update internally
  - Or when other thread blocks and waits for rendering thread
 - Create a simple distinction so user knows when is something executed deferred and when immediate?
  - Move resource update/create methods to DeferredContext?
    - Not ALL methods need to be moved, only those that are resource heavy
    - Smaller methods may remain and always stay async, but keep internal state?
 - Resource creation on DX11 should be direct though, without a queue (especially if we manage to populate a resource in the same step)
 - Remove & replace internal data copying in GpuParamBlock (or just use a allocator instead of new())

<<<<RenderSystem needed modifications>>>>
  - Texture resource views (Specifying just a subresource of a texture as a shader parameter)
  - UAV for textures
  - Stream out (write vertex buffers) (DX11 and GL)
  - Texture buffers 
   - Just add a special texture type? OpenGL doesn't support getting offset from within a texture buffer anyway
  - Tesselation (hull/domain) shader
  - Detachable and readable depthstencil buffer (Window buffers not required as they behave a bit differently in OpenGL)
  - OpenGL provides image load/store which seems to be GL UAV equivalent (http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Image_Load_Store)
  - Resolving MSAA textures (i.e. copying them to non-MSAA so they can be displayed on-screen). DX has ResolveSubresource, and OpenGL might have something similar.
  - Single and dual channel textures (especially render textures, which are very important for effects like SSAO)
  - Compute pipeline
  - Instancing (DrawInstanced) (DX11 and GL)
  - OpenGL append/consume buffers
  - Indirect drawing via indirect argument buffers
  - Texture arrays
  - Rendertargets that aren't just 2D (Volumetric (3D) render targets in particular)
  - Shader support for doubles
  - Dynamic shader linkage (Interfaces and similar)
  - Multisampled texture resources
  - Multiple adapters (multi gpu)
  - Passing initial data when creating a resource (DX11, but possibly GL too)
  - Sample mask when setting blend state (DX11, check if equivalent exists in GL)
  - RGBA blend factor when setting blend state(DX11, check if equivalent exists in GL)
  - HLSL9/HLSL11/GLSL/Cg shaders need preprocessor defines & includes

Command buffer TODO:
 - Make CommandQueue not use mutexes and use atomics instead??
 - Figure out how to handle accessing texture from a non-render thread?
 - When importing a resource, and registering it with Resources I don't think it properly gets added to the loaded resources array? For some reason shaders get created twice.
 - Doing setPixels_async in the texture doesn't make sure that the user doesn't actually modify the provided PixelData after
    that call.
 - In general I need to rethink how to handle modifying resources with multithreading

Editor IMPORTANT:
 - When displaying inspector data for a component, take into consideration that it will need to be able
    to display that data for user created C# classes as well. AND I will most certainly have C# versions of all my
	components. Therefore is there any purpose of having C++ only inspector parsing code?

-----------------------BACKLOG TODO---------------------------------------------------------------

HIGH PRIORITY TODO:
 - GetRenderOperation doesn't consider sub-meshes

Mid priority TODO:
 - monitorIndex is ignored in DX11
 - Add a field that tracks % of resource deserialization in BinarySerializer
 - Mesh loading:
  - Example Freefall mesh has one index per vertex, and there are 17k+ vertices. I think I need a post-process step that optimizes them.
  - Imported FBX meshes are too big
 - Ogre performed special DDS loading. I removed that. I'm not sure if I'll need to re-add it?
 - My log is not thread safe yet it is being called from multiple threads.
 - Handling of shader array parameters? This needs testing
   - I'm currently ignoring array elements in GL due to the name their names are handled
 - RTTI:
     When defining RTTIType like so: 
      RTTIType<D3D9HLSLProgram, HighLevelGpuProgram, D3D9HLSLProgramRTTI>
     I need to make sure that HighLevelGpuProgram class has valid RTTI type as well. Otherwise the inheritance hierarchy will not be correct. Right now this isn't checked anywhere.

Low priority TODO:
 - Mesh loading:
  - Sub-meshes aren't being transformed by world matrices of their nodes
 - Remove template from RTTIType and move it to IReflectable? This way i can hopefully move GetRTTITypeStatic and GetRTTIType to IReflectable so I don't
   need to manually implement those for every method.
 - Viewport needs to be updated when I call RenderTarget::setFullscreen/finishSwitchingFullscreen/updateWindowRect/windowMovedOrResized. Currently it's not
 - D3D9Texture::createTextureResources is commented out at the moment. It gets called on device reset, and at that point I should reload texture resources.
  - I should probably keep all resources by DX managed. OpenGL apparently keeps a mirror of all its resources anyway.
 - Device reset and resource re-loading in general
 - In RTTIType it is possible to add a non-plain data type using addPlainField. This can cause memory corruption issues
   if pointer is saved/loaded as a plain field. I need to add a check that ensures the type is POD. 
   See: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/boost/mpi/datatype.hpp for a possible implementation of a compile time check.
 - Fix up WorkQueue as it doesn't lock when initializing, to make sure threads are actually started before returning
 - CPU reading or writing to a render texture in OpenGL is not supported. (CmGLHardwarePixelBuffer::upload/download). 
 - When saving a resource, make sure resource is properly loaded before saving
   - Add doc to Resources::save that says it will block until render thread updates the resource
   - Add documentation that tells the user that reading a resource non-async will block the thread and execute all queued render commands first
   - Remove Response handlers from Resources
- Cg doesn't work. Either remove it or get it to work
- System is not yet ready for multiple rendering contexts

Optional TODO:
 - Add precompiled headers to all projects
 - If possible, make sure GLSL uses EntryPoint and Profile fields I have added to GpuProgram
 - Move all x86 libs to x86 folders. Move all binaries to x86 folders as well
 - Serializable callbacks can't be null otherwise compiler complains
 - FBX importer can be greatly sped up by implementing a better allocator
 - Extend texture copy so it accepts different subregions & subresources (currently only entire resource can be copied)
 - Need a way to convert MSAA render texture into a normal render texture
 - Vertex buffer start offset is not supported when calling Draw methods
 - Issue with deserialization and value types:
  - Value types are only set at the end of deserialization, because I want to be sure all of their fields are initialized. 
     However there is nothing stopping a custom RTTI method from accessing a (yet uninitialized) value in a ptr field. 
	 (See CmMaterialRTTI, setTexParam). I need to initialize fields in a better order.)
 - Creating stuff like gpu program include and shader, etc. still require initialize() (call to render thread)

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After everything is polished
 - Each view (i.e. camera) of the scene should be put into its own thread
 - How do I handle multiple mesh formats? Some files need animation, other don't. Some would mabye like to use QTangent, others the proper tangent frame.
  - Asset postprocessor? Imports a regular mesh using normal importers and then postprocesses it into a specialized format?
 - Load texture mips separately so we can unload HQ textures from far away objects (like UE3)
 - Add Unified shader so I can easily switch between HLSL and GLSL shaders (they need same parameters usually, just different code)
    - Maybe just add support for Cg and force everyone to use that? - I'd like to be able to just switch out renderer in a single location and that everything keeps on working without 
	  further modifications.
 - Port boost threads to std threads (CmThreadDefines.h)
 - Remove HardwarePixelBuffer (DX11 doesn't use it, and DX9 and OpenGL textures can be rewritten so they have its methods internally)
 - Multihead device
 - 3D rendering (use low level hardware methods for it)
 
 - Don't forget to check out Unity DX11 documentation on how to implement DX11 features (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/DirectX11.html)
 - Go to Game Engine Architecture book and make a list of Utility systems we will need (Config files, Parsers, File I/O etc)
 - Go to GEA book and read about resource managers before implementing them
   - Actually I should re-read most of the chapers in the book, or all of it
 - When building internal GUI make sure to use CEGUI as a reference

 - OpenGL non-Win32 window files haven't been properly parsed or tested
   - Since I probably can't compile them, try adding them to VS and see what intellisense says?

 - Textures and all other buffers keep a copy of their data in system memory. If there are memory constraints we might need a way to avoid this.
