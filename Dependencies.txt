Camelot relies on following 3rd party libraries:
 - Boost 1.49 (Later versions might work as well, but you need to test it on your own)


Make sure to include:
 - Library include files in /Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in /Dependencies/lib/Debug and /Dependencies/lib/Release
 - Dynamic library files in /bin/Debug and /bin/Release (Possibly others if you define other configuration types)
