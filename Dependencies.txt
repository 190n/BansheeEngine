Camelot relies on the following 3rd party libraries:
 - Boost 1.49
    - http://www.boost.org
 - Cg 3.1
    - http://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit

Place dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Camelot plug-in dependencies:

CamelotFBXImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FBX SDK 2013.3
   - http://usa.autodesk.com/fbx

CamelotFreeImgImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FreeImage 3.13.1
  - http://freeimage.sourceforge.net

CamelotFontImporter (optional) relies on:
 - Freetype 2.3.5
  - http://www.freetype.org
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: When compiling as static library make sure to define "FREETYPE2_STATIC". It is not defined by default
    in provided Visual Studio projects, which can cause a headache.

CamelotOISInput relies on:
 - CamelotOIS - Slightly modified version of OIS 1.3 specifically for Camelot
  - Supplied with Camelot source code but compiled as a separate project into a dependency

Place plug-in specific dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

 Legend:
  (BansheeRootDir) - Path to BansheeEngine folder
  (Platform) - Platform you're compiling for, e.g. Win32, x64, etc.
             - In some cases 32bit platforms don't reside in their own platform folder, in which case ignore this field
  (Configuration) - Debug, Release, etc.

Other notes:
 - If possible all dependencies should be compiled without unicode or multi-character support, in case you experience any issues when passing strings between
	module boundaries.

Listed dependencies have not been provided with the engine source code. 
You will need to grab them manually from the specified links, 
(compile them, depending if library comes pre-compiled or not), 
and place them in the above specified folders.
