Banshee relies on the following 3rd party libraries:
 - Mono 3.2.3
    - http://www.mono-project.com
	- See MonoIntegrationGuide.txt on how to compile & integrate Mono

Place dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Banshee plug-in dependencies:

CamelotFBXImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FBX SDK 2015.1
   - http://usa.autodesk.com/fbx

CamelotFreeImgImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FreeImage 3.13.1
  - http://freeimage.sourceforge.net

CamelotFontImporter (optional) relies on:
 - Freetype 2.3.5
  - http://www.freetype.org
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: When compiling as static library make sure to define "FREETYPE2_STATIC". It is not defined by default
    in provided Visual Studio projects, which can cause a headache.

CamelotOISInput relies on:
 - CamelotOIS - Slightly modified version of OIS 1.3 specifically for Banshee
  - Supplied with Banshee source code but compiled as a separate project into a dependency

Place plug-in specific dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

 Legend:
  (BansheeRootDir) - Path to BansheeEngine folder
  (Platform) - Platform you're compiling for, e.g. x86, x64, etc.
  (Configuration) - Debug, Release, DebugRelease

Other notes:
 - Some dependencies might not come with DebugRelease binaries, in which case use Release binaries (copy them to DebugRelease folder)

Listed dependencies have not been provided with the engine source code. 
You will need to grab them manually from the specified links, 
(compile them, depending if library comes pre-compiled or not), 
and place them in the above specified folders.
