-------------
Cursor
 - A way to save/load a set of cursors

 IMMEDIATE:
  - Deleting first entry in input field moves the cursor incorrectly
  - Test if parsing int/float value from int/float field actually works
  - ProfilerOverlay elements are constantly dirty? even though I'm not calling update

Other:
 - Refactor BuiltinMaterialFactory to BuiltinEngineResources

-------------

When Inspector is displayed a SerializedObject of a Component (or some other type) is created
 - It will contain a list of SerializedFields, which you can call set/get on (setInt, setString, setObject, setArray, etc.)
 - It will also know its own type in an enum
 - You can query all SerializedFields of an SerializedObject or find individual ones by name

You can call EditorGUI.SerializedField to automatically draw GUI depending on field type.
 - Or SerializedObject to draw GUI for entire object

------------
PRIMARY advantage of handling properties like this, instead of making custom inspectors and calling GUI methods manually is that you get undo/redo support.
ALSO I need tab movement
