Needed controls:
Array field/List field/Dictionary field
Matrix3 field
Matrix4 field
GameObject field
Resource field

Update C++ side of the GUI so it properly uses GUIPanels
 - (Remove current GUI and EditorGUI and replace them with GUIPanel)
 - Ensure GUI panel clips any of its child GUIAreas to the panel area

Remove support for resizeable areas (Update ScriptGUIArea)

Things to think about/do:
 - Inspectable fields need TAB support
  - Modify C++ GUIElement so I can do setNextTabElement(GUIElement*)
 - Inspectable fields need Undo/Redo support. Consider how to best implement it
  - C++ Undo/Redo system needs nested contexts
  - C++ Ensure that Undo/Redo works on per-field basis (undoing items within a field)
  - Add C# UndoRedo
 - Modify C++ Editor fields so that calling setValue doesn't update the visual value until focus is lost
  - When user is currently writing in an input box I don't want refresh to overwrite that value.
 - Expand/Collapse needs to work for both Components and their sub-objects (Structs, Arrays, etc.)
 - Support for initializing SerializableObject/SerializableArray (and their fields, together with getters/setters)
 - How do I refresh currently visible inspector fields.
   - Also how will this be done with custom inspectors, when I might not use InspectableObject
 - Currently I do not have a way to creating an Inspector field for just a single field, only for an entire object
 - Finally once all other things are done implement support for multi-rank arrays, lists and dictionaries


How will UndoRedo keep a reference to the object? 
 - What if the object gets destroyed? 
 - Keeping a reference will prevent the object from being destroyed.
   - Although heavy stuff is destroyed manually via Destroy anyway

 ----------------------

 Non-inspector:

  - Deleting first entry in input field moves the cursor incorrectly
  - Test if parsing int/float value from int/float field actually works
  - ProfilerOverlay elements are constantly dirty? even though I'm not calling update

Refactor BuiltinMaterialFactory to BuiltinEngineResources

Cursor
 - A way to save/load a set of cursors

Get rid of the CamelotFramework namespace
 - I shouldn't need to prefix each variable with CM::

Undocking a window wont remove the tabbed title bar
While dragging an undocked window, dropping it over the main window (not over dock overlays) will not restore it

 - GameObjectField
   - When dragging over GameObjectField cursor needs to change depending whether drop will be accepted or not
   - How will I limit it to just certain component types?

Make a common class for ScriptGUIElement as they all share:
 - Destroy(), DestroyInstance(), SetParent(), SetVisible() methods, and potentially others

Add InsertElement to GUILayout
