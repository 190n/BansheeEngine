DropDownList
 - 2 states
   - Closed - Pretty much a normal button with a drop down arrow
   - Open - Creates a new GUIArea in the current widget
        - The area is always sized so it doesn't go outside the widget
        - Area is full of GUIButtons with callbacks set up so that the GUIArea gets destroyed when selection is made
        - If GUIButtons don't fully fit in the area then top and bottom display arrow buttons you may press to scroll through them
             - Arrows change pages, not element-by-element


IMMEDIATE:
 - Add up/down drop down arrows (need Textures)
