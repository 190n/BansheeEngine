DropDownBox
 - Like ScrollArea, has 0 width and contains just buttons
   - Set up three button types, plus bg for top/bottom buttons
 - Sets up callbacks to all of the buttons
   - Clicking on entry buttons closes it and notifies parent DropDownList
   - Clicking on scroll buttons updates the data

GUIManager::createDropDownBox(GUIWidget parent, Int2 position, vector<String> data, function selectedCallback)
 - Creates a GUIArea in the specified widget
   - Positions it under the wanted position, with height determined by widget window parent
   - Width is some fixed value predefined in GUIManager
 - Automatically closes the area when the user changes focus to non-drop down box element

Same approach can be used for Menus
 GUIManager::createDropDownMenu
   - Except they can cascade so multiple menus may be open at the same time
