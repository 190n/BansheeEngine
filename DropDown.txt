GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Doesn't belong here but as an additional reminder: Remove Component::initialize and instead make multi paramter addComponent

Once drop down menu is open the initial button (for listbox and menubar) should remain in active state
Mousing over other buttons in menu bar should open their menus
 - GUIManager currently blocks input to anything but currently open drop down box. Maybe also allow input
    on the drop down box owner (Might be tricky since MenuBar consists of multiple different elements).
MouseOver over sub-menu buttons doesn't trigger hover style

Add min/max/close buttons to GUIMenuBar
Setup move areas in GUIMenuBar

ListBox: Clicking on ListBox once the DropDownBox is open should close the drop down box (I assume it does, it just re-opens it immediately again?)

Test scrollUp/scrollDown
