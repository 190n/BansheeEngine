GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Doesn't belong here but as an additional reminder: Remove Component::initialize and instead make multi paramter addComponent

Once drop down menu is open the initial button (for listbox and menubar) should remain in active state
Mousing over other buttons in menu bar should open their menus

ListBox: Clicking on ListBox once the DropDownBox is open should close the drop down box (I assume it does, it just re-opens it immediately again?)

Add min/max/close buttons to GUIMenuBar
Setup move areas in GUIMenuBar

Test scrollUp/scrollDown


Design improvements:
Attempt to get rid of selective input click callback in GUIManager. It's too specific.
 - Instead of using selective input I might be able to block all input using event filter (by adding return values to them)
   - Some kind of GUISelectiveInput class? I think it makes sense to move it out of GUIManager
