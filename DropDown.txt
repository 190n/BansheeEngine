GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Context menu appears at the wrong coordinates
Menus lack proper frame

Test scrollUp/scrollDown

Design improvements:
Attempt to get rid of selective input click callback in GUIManager. It's too specific.
 - Instead of using selective input I might be able to block all input using event filter (by adding return values to them)
   - Some kind of GUISelectiveInput class? I think it makes sense to move it out of GUIManager
