GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Doesn't belong here but as an additional reminder: Remove Component::initialize and instead make multi paramter addComponent

Add min/max/close buttons to GUIMenuBar
Setup move areas in GUIMenuBar

Test context
Test scrollUp/scrollDown


Design improvements:
Attempt to get rid of selective input click callback in GUIManager. It's too specific.
 - Instead of using selective input I might be able to block all input using event filter (by adding return values to them)
   - Some kind of GUISelectiveInput class? I think it makes sense to move it out of GUIManager
