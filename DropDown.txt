GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Immediate TODO:
 - Add separator images
   - Make it in PS, just a single image
   - Add support for it in DropDownBox
      - Elements with "-" as contents automatically become separators
	  - PROBLEM: With scrolling. Right now I assume all elements are the same size but when separators
	    are used I can no longer scroll that way. TODO
		 - Add a better way of updating GUIButtons (a way that actuall adds/removes them)
		 - Can also be used for handling of add/remove scrollup/scrolldown buttons
 - Add expand right arrow
   - Add scale9grid where the right side has the arrow
   - Callback hooked up just opens another context window
     - Managing this is taken care of on a higher level (GUIManager or similar)
 - Upon scroll up/down remove ScrollUp or ScrollDown buttons if that direction isn't usable anymore
  - Delete its GUIArea and offset the content area, and possibly ScrollDown area

----------------------------
 - Elements can call addContextAction("Name", "Callback")
   - This will be automatically rendered by GUIManager as a drop down menu when user clicks on it
     - This kind of drop down menu will require separator buttons
     - Also buttons with sub-menus
     - It is probably useful to just add this functionality to DropDownBox
   - Mousing over a sub-menu should upen another DropDownBox at that location
     - I might need to modify DropDownBox input parameters so they accept GUElement as a parent, and not just GUIDropDownList
     - Also another parameter to specify on which side of the GUIElement to open the box
   - GUIManager drop down system could be extended so it handles multiple drop down boxes from various sources
    - DropDownLists, context menus and toolbar menus
