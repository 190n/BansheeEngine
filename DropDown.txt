GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

When opening a sub-menu it might overlap its parent menu. e.g. opening a sub-menu to the left of the parent menu. 
 - Sub-menu bounds should be limited so that they can't overlap.
   - Nested overlap should be allowed to happen as long as the last menu is visible. This is why menus will also need proper depth.

Test scrollUp/scrollDown
 - Scroll up/down button arrows seem to be missing

Design improvements:
Attempt to get rid of selective input click callback in GUIManager. It's too specific.
 - Instead of using selective input I might be able to block all input using event filter (by adding return values to them)
   - Some kind of GUISelectiveInput class? I think it makes sense to move it out of GUIManager
