GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Doesn't belong here but as an additional reminder: Remove Component::initialize and instead make multi paramter addComponent

GUIDropDownBox::openSubMenu
 - I need to provide a parent element, also I probably need a way to distinguish between original drop down box, and sub-menu one

GUIContextMenu::getDropDownData needs to be implemented
GUIDropDownBox only accepts a GUIElement, while GUIContextMenu only specifies a position

GUIMenuBar
 - It has a specific position, width and height
 - It was a GUIArea and its root elements are represented as buttons
   - CLicking on a button will open up the menu, similar to context menu
   - GUIManager::openMenu(Vector<GUIDropDownData>, GUIElement* parent)

Test separators
Test expandable buttons
 - And hook up on mouse over
 - ALSO I need to close other menu at the same level upon mouse over on another element
Test scrollUp/scrollDown
