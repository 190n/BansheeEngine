GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Doesn't belong here but as an additional reminder: Remove Component::initialize and instead make multi paramter addComponent

GUIContextMenu::getDropDownData needs to be implemented

ListBox: Clicking on ListBox once the DropDownBox is open should close the drop down box (I assume it does, it just re-opens it immediately again?)

GUIMenuBar
 - It has a specific position, width and height
 - It was a GUIArea and its root elements are represented as buttons
   - CLicking on a button will open up the menu, similar to context menu
   - GUIManager::openMenu(Vector<GUIDropDownData>, GUIElement* parent)

Test separators
Test expandable buttons
 - And hook up on mouse over
 - ALSO I need to close other menu at the same level upon mouse over on another element
Test scrollUp/scrollDown
