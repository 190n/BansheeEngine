GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Doesn't belong here but as an additional reminder: Remove Component::initialize and instead make multi paramter addComponent
 - There's an exception that happens where mStyle of a GUIButtonBase is not initialized
 - Track down other uses of initialize() and remove them (GUIWidget has one, probably Camera and similar as well)

Test context
 - There are issues when dealing with the context menu. Hover doesn't seem to close menus, and hovering for a few seconds seems to cause an exception.

Test scrollUp/scrollDown

Design improvements:
Attempt to get rid of selective input click callback in GUIManager. It's too specific.
 - Instead of using selective input I might be able to block all input using event filter (by adding return values to them)
   - Some kind of GUISelectiveInput class? I think it makes sense to move it out of GUIManager
