GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Immediate TODO:
 - Hook up ScrollUp and ScrollDown events in GUIDropDownBox

 GUIMenuBar
 - Create top level buttons in PS
 - Derives from GUIWidget and can be easily added to a window
 - AddMenuItem("Scene/Components/Camera", addCameraCallback)
  - Automatically creates entire menu hierarchy (or just adds it to an existing submenu)
 - GetMenuItem("Scene/Components")
  - Returns a MenuItem which may have multiple MenuItem children
 - RemoveMenuItem(MenuItem* item)

----------------------------
 - Elements can call addContextAction("Name", "Callback")
   - This will be automatically rendered by GUIManager as a drop down menu when user clicks on it
     - This kind of drop down menu will require separator buttons
     - Also buttons with sub-menus
     - It is probably useful to just add this functionality to DropDownBox
   - Mousing over a sub-menu should upen another DropDownBox at that location
     - I might need to modify DropDownBox input parameters so they accept GUElement as a parent, and not just GUIDropDownList
     - Also another parameter to specify on which side of the GUIElement to open the box
   - GUIManager drop down system could be extended so it handles multiple drop down boxes from various sources
    - DropDownLists, context menus and toolbar menus
