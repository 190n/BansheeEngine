GUI ignores image in GUIContent for most elements.

Doesn't belong here but as an additional reminder: Remove Component::initialize and instead make multi paramter addComponent

Attempt to get rid of selective input click callback. It's too specific.
 - Instead of using selective input I might be able to block all input using event filter (by adding return values to them)
   - Some kind of GUISelectiveInput class? I think it makes sense to move it out of GUIManager

I will need a GUIDropDownBoxManager because otherwise I have no way of ensuring only one drop down box is active at a time
 Principle remains the same, I call GUIDropDownBox::open and internally it calls the manager

Once drop down menu is open the initial button (for listbox and menubar) should remain in active state
Mousing over other buttons in menu bar should open their menus

ListBox: Clicking on ListBox once the DropDownBox is open should close the drop down box (I assume it does, it just re-opens it immediately again?)

Add min/max/close buttons to GUIMenuBar
Setup move areas in GUIMenuBar

Test scrollUp/scrollDown
