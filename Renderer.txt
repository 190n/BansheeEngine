Param matching missing:
 - Add default DX9/DX11/OpenGL shaders

-----------------------------------------------------------
NON TRIVIAL BUT SIMPLE

Actually add frustum culling
Implement RenderQueue sorting with support for sort type, priority and separable pass
 - Use a hash list(containing type, queue, layer, etc.) for faster sorting

-----------------------------------------------------------
REFACTORING, NOTES AND OTHER TRIVIAL STUFF

Finally
 - Document elements marked with TODO UNDOCUMENTED
 - Refactor/rename everything so it makes more sense. Possibly lay out a design diagram.
 - Get rid of Camera::getIgnoreSceneRenderables it can be doing using layers

Semantic/design issues:
 - DrawList is too similar to RenderQueue - Their names need to be more distinct
 - Consider removing SceneManager from Core? I two scene manager base classes.
 - GpuParamBlockBuffer and GpuParams::cloneForCore are very clumsy in how they deal in keeping two separate param blocks. Rethink this a bit.

---------------------------

Just notes for later potentially:
 - I can only update entire Mesh at once. 
 - I keep bounds for the entire mesh and not per-submesh
 - I don't serialize bounds and they are recalculated whenever a mesh is loaded
