Test HString:
 - Test parameters
 - Test changing language
 - Test changing string
 - Test removing string

 HString needs to be introduced in:
 - Label, Button, Toggle, Listbox
   - Also needs a callback so those elements can be marked as dirty when it is changed
 - Context menu & menu bar
   - How do I change this when HString is modified or language is changed?
   - Allow the user to set custom menu name (name used only for display)
     - Normally the name provided in menu path is used but user can set a localized string if he wants
 - Title bar & window names
