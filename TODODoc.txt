 - Render system threading:
   - Make a list of thread-safe RenderSystem classes
    - For example HighLevelGpuProgram is thread safe but GpuProgram itself isn't
    - Classes that are safe to use outside of the render thread: RenderSystem, Mesh, Texture, HighLevelGpuProgram, Material, Shader, Technique
	- Classes that are only accessible from the render thread: GpuProgram, HardwarePixelBuffer, HardwareVertexBuffer, HardwareIndexBuffer
  - Make sure the user knows resources are shared between contexts. All resource updates are executed 
     before rendering a frame, so whichever context updated the resource last, was the version that will be used.
  - GLSL limitations
     - layout(row_major) is not supported and will likely result in incorrect matrices
  - Texture limitations: Only 1D, 2D, 3D and Cube textures (and their samplers) are supported. Support for multisampled textures
     is included where necessary to implement render targets. Support for texture arrays and is not included.
