Make sure to also update TextSprite and ImageSprite and anything else in UpdateMesh, then don't forget to find the issue that causes elements to get marked as dirty every single frame

FrameAlloc
   Keeps two internal stacks
     - One core, one sim
   coreThreadBegin()
    - swaps the active stacks
   coreThreadEnd() - Must be called after Core thread has finished
    - frees the previously active stack
   During frame we call alloc()
  
 There are many allocations in CPUProfiler (especially report generation), and they aren't counted anywhere since they use
 a special allocator.

--------------------

When optimizing UpdateLayout make sure to mark elements that are fully culled as Culled
 - But in order to determine that I first need to update the sprite to find out the elements bounds which defeats the point
 - TODO - FIgure this out

BIG TODO FINALLY: Reorganize GUI so it all uses one big vertex buffer (probably in the form of a TransientMesh). This means I need better support for drawing individual objects
from a transient mesh by drawing only parts of its buffer. But only do this after I have optimized and tested the normal mesh (on all render systems)


----------

When writing to buffer in MeshHeap (in two places at least) I need to add NO_OVERWITE flag to HardwareBuffer
When doing allocInternal I don't check that index/vertex desc in MeshData actually matches the ones in MeshHeap.
