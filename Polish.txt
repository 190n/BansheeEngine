There's still a crash regarding an uninitialized mCachedPtr on a C# class when shutting down. Attempt to find consistent repro steps.

Finish GPUProfiler:
 - Actually implement sampling and report generation
 - Add timer and occlusion queries
 - Resource writes/reads/creation/destruction is not currently increased in RenderStats

 ---------------------------

 Make hierarchical documentation. Organize stuff based on type. Once I actually generate the documentation add Doxygen grouping tags (or whatever they're called)

 ---------------------------

 Fullscreen stuff:

Add VideoModeInfo to OpenGL and DX9. Remove any existing functionality.
 - Don't forget desktop mode
 - Don't forget child window check

Test if it all works. Especially going fullscreen on another monitor.
When initializing a render window I don't have an option to use exact refresh rate (i.e. in RENDER_WINDOW_DESC)

 EnumDisplayMonitors - Get all available monitors

GetMonitorInfo - Get display name for monitor
 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd144901(v=vs.85).aspx
ChangeDisplaySettingEx - For actually changing resolution and refresh rate
 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183413(v=vs.85).aspx
EnumDisplaySettings  - To query all available resolutions and refresh rates
 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd162611(v=vs.85).aspx

RenderSystem
 - Allow for querying multiple monitors
 - Allow querying for all possible resolutions and refresh rates (for each monitor specifically)
 - Allow querying for desktop resolution and refresh rate

in window setFullscreen add a refresh rate setting, and a monitor index
