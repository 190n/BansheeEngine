There's still a crash regarding an uninitialized mCachedPtr on a C# class when shutting down. Attempt to find consistent repro steps.

Finish GPUProfiler:
 - Actually implement sampling and report generation
 - Add timer and occlusion queries
 - Resource writes/reads/creation/destruction is not currently increased in RenderStats

 ---------------------------

 Make hierarchical documentation. Organize stuff based on type. Once I actually generate the documentation add Doxygen grouping tags (or whatever they're called)

 ---------------------------

 Fullscreen stuff:

 In DX9 RenderWindow delete _finishSwitchingFullscreen method if possible after I test fullscreen switching
 Update OpenGL render window set fullscreen methods.

Test if it all works. Especially going fullscreen on another monitor.
When initializing a render window I don't have an option to use exact refresh rate (i.e. in RENDER_WINDOW_DESC)

ChangeDisplaySettingEx - For actually changing resolution and refresh rate

 -----------------------------

 Refactor:
 - Make CmApplication a base of BsApplication
 - If I merge CmApp and BsApp consider refactoring CmApplication::mainLoopCallback
