There's still a crash regarding an uninitialized mCachedPtr on a C# class when shutting down. Attempt to find consistent repro steps.

Finish GPUProfiler:
 - Actually implement sampling and report generation
 - Add timer and occlusion queries
 - Resource writes/reads/creation/destruction is not currently increased in RenderStats

 ---------------------------

 Make hierarchical documentation. Organize stuff based on type. Once I actually generate the documentation add Doxygen grouping tags (or whatever they're called)

 ---------------------------

 Fullscreen stuff:

When initializing a render window I don't have an option to use exact refresh rate (i.e. in RENDER_WINDOW_DESC)
 - Likely use a VideoMode you can create manually

I should be able to specify resolution when going to windowed mode
 - Maybe just store the windowed and fullscreen resolutions separately and restore automatically?

OpenGL going back from windowed mode doesn't restore window style properly.
OpenGL doesn't list windows in the same order as DirectX

Switching from higher to lower resoltuion in DX9 causes an issue where viewport is larger than the render target. (Only with debug runtime - Can probably ignore)
When toggling fullscreen two times device reset fails
In DX9 render window I have disabled top most style.
  - If needed re-enable it, if not remove it from OpenGL as well as I think it disables alt+tab

DISREGARD MONITOR INDEX ON DX9
 - It's not trivial and its not worth wasting time on a deprecated system

 -----------------------------

 Refactor:
 - Make CmApplication a base of BsApplication
 - If I merge CmApp and BsApp consider refactoring CmApplication::mainLoopCallback
