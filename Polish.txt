There's still a crash regarding an uninitialized mCachedPtr on a C# class when shutting down. Attempt to find consistent repro steps.

Finish GPUProfiler:
 - Actually implement sampling and report generation
 - Add timer and occlusion queries
 - Resource writes/reads/creation/destruction is not currently increased in RenderStats

 ---------------------------

 Make hierarchical documentation. Organize stuff based on type. Once I actually generate the documentation add Doxygen grouping tags (or whatever they're called)

 ---------------------------

 Fullscreen stuff:

 In DX9 RenderWindow delete _finishSwitchingFullscreen method if possible after I test fullscreen switching
 Update OpenGL render window set fullscreen methods.

Test if it all works. Especially going fullscreen on another monitor.
When initializing a render window I don't have an option to use exact refresh rate (i.e. in RENDER_WINDOW_DESC)

ChangeDisplaySettingEx - For actually changing resolution and refresh rate
 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183413(v=vs.85).aspx

 Add ability to change FSAA on RenderWindow.
  - Maybe later. OpenGL requires window to be re-created for it to change I think. As SetPixelFormat is allowed to be called just once per window

Add a better way of specifying FSAA (and don't call it FSAA because it's multisampling)
 - fsaaHint is useless in most cases. Add an Enum instead.

I should be able to specify resolution when going to windowed mode
 - Maybe just store the windowed and fullscreen resolutions separately and restore automatically?

OpenGL going back from windowed mode doesn't restore window style properly.

 -----------------------------

 Refactor:
 - Make CmApplication a base of BsApplication
 - If I merge CmApp and BsApp consider refactoring CmApplication::mainLoopCallback
