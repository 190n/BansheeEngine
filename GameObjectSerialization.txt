TODO
 - Ability to break external references as a pre-processing step
 - I need to properly unload all assemblies (and possibly shutdown mono runtime?) before I shut down various modules used in ScriptBansheeEngine.

 ---------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE:

setValue in ScriptSerializableObject & ScriptSerializableArray should check if value is null and if the field type isn't a value type (can't be null)

LOW PRIORITY
- Add Multi-dimensional arrays / Lists / Dictionaries
  - (To get array lengths per rank I probably need to cast to System.Array and then call GetLength)
  - For List/Dictionary I will probably want to do it though ICollection interface
  - Use mono_object_get_virtual_method() to get virtual method
  - Getting a generic type: Try mono_reflection_type_from_name
- Ensure that unknown components retain their field data so when they are no longer unknown their data may be restored
- Get rid of ScriptObject::createInstance and replace it with parameter in constructor
- A way to serialize any object into a Resource (and deserialize it from Resource)

----------------------------------------

I attempt to resolve SceneObject handle during deserialization, while it should only be done after deserialization is done
 - Issue happens in ScriptSerializableFieldDataGameObjectRef::getValue

HACKY WAY: <- THE RIGHT WAY
 - I can add a callback to GameObject that gets triggered when deserialization for a GameObject is fully done
 - Then I perform ManagedComponent deserilization there
 - SerializableSceneObject & SerializableSceneArray would have to be modified so that they don't resolve fields on deserialization

In ScriptSerializableObject & ScriptSerializableArray add:
 serializeManagedInstance <- Called when serialization starts and recursively
 deserializeManagedInstance <- Called by the deserialization callback in ManagedComponent and recursively

 ---------------------------------------

 Testing:
Test arrays
Test arrays of arrays
Test references to Components
Test references to Resources
Test how structs work
Test how things work when class gets removed

Test and implement multi-rank arrays

 ------------------------------------------------------
 General C# component management

 Native components like Camera
  - ScriptCamera derives from Camera
    - Then whenever I check for managed Components I need to check if object type of ScriptComponent or
	  any of the built-in types. 
	   - Checking each type might be a bit slow, but normally we will be looking for an exact type
	     so hopefully this will only matter when enumerating all components which shouldn't be during performance
		 critical moments.

TODO - When reloading scripts how to handle restoring references?
TODO - When I destroy a Component, how will I refresh the inspector to let it know that something has changed
  - Can happen from C# and C++
