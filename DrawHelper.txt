Add class DrawHelper:
 - Line2D_AA - Creates an emulated AA line using triangles. See Recast/imguiRenderGL::drawPolygon for implementation. Line vertices and colors
      are appended in the specified buffer. No actual drawing is done.
 - Line2D_Pixel - Creates a simple line using LINE primitive topology. Line vertices and colors are appended in the specified buffer.
 - Quad2D 
 - QuadBorder2D_AA
 - QuadBorder2D_Pixel
 - LineList2D_AA
 - LineList2D_Pixel
 - RoundedRect2D - Also copy from Recast/imguiRenderGL::drawRoundedRect
 - Also 3D equivalents
  - Line, Quad, QuadBorder, Box, BoxBorder

 - Then I also need draw* equivalents of those methods. draw equivalents will also create the buffer and submit the draw call.

--------------------------

 Only one material per viewport needs to exist, no need for separate material for each element

-------------------------

AA lines render but look a bit off.

Num verts/indices for polygon2d_AA method:
(n * 2) vertices
(n * 6) + max(0, n - 2) * 3
