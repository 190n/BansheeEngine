Add class DrawHelper:
 - Line2D_AA - Creates an emulated AA line using triangles. See Recast/imguiRenderGL::drawPolygon for implementation. Line vertices and colors
      are appended in the specified buffer. No actual drawing is done.
 - Line2D_Pixel - Creates a simple line using LINE primitive topology. Line vertices and colors are appended in the specified buffer.
 - ScreenQuad - accepts normalized viewport coordinates
 - Quad2D - accepts pixel coordinates
 - QuadBorder2D_AA
 - QuadBorder2D_Pixel
 - LineList2D_AA
 - LineList2D_Pixel
 - RoundedRect2D - Also copy from Recast/imguiRenderGL::drawRoundedRect
 - Also 3D equivalents
  - Line, Quad, QuadBorder, Box, BoxBorder

 - Then I also need draw* equivalents of those methods. draw equivalents will also create the buffer and submit the draw call.

--------------------------

 Port the 2D shader so it accepts viewport size. Because we want things to be defined in pixels (except for fullscreen quad)
 Only one material per viewport needs to exist, no need for separate material for each element
