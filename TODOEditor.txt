TODO for next few days:
 - Layout manager that saves/restores user layout
   - Keeps position, size ands possibly docking information for every window
     (Main window probably needs to be handled specially)
   - At startup all windows register with it
   - Calling restore() will place all windows in proper positions
   - It will also set up hooks to those windows so it gets updates when they get moved/sized/docked
 - Project create/Project open window
   - Shows at the start of the editor
   - Also has hooks directly from File menu (Create project, Open project)
 - EditorPrefs class
   - Stores all of editor preferences, including layout information
   - Also keeps a list of all known projects
 - Menu bar:
   - File->Create project, File->Open project
   - Windows menu with a list of all windows
     - List gets populated easily so people can write plugin windows
	  - Plugin windows should possibly also be able to assign themselves to other Menu item than Windows
 - Docking system
   - All open windows can be docked/unocked
   - Their layout data gets saved
   - The way I handle editor windows at the moment is pretty weird with alot of custom handling for resize/move
     - Attempt to get rid of that or at least dont use it until I have window look more fleshed out
 - Make sure entire interface is skinnable
