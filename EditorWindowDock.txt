Add icons to drag and drop - There's a built-in windows icon for this. I think. Although solution that accepts custom cursors is probably better longterm. (Special class BuiltinCursors?)
 - Drag and drop manager currently ignores the provided icon, but it should use it as a cursor

Fix an issue where drag and dropping a window for the second times causes an exception

Add highlight to WindowMover so I can know when I'm mousing over it with a dragged window in hand
Ensure that dropping a window onto a mover will actually dock it properly

Change WindowMover to GUIToggle since move functionality has been removed from it.

Actually set up client areas for resize and move
 - Figure out how to deal with Cursor change in WindowFrame and non-client areas (which will likely be done in a parent class)
   - Possibly add two different types of client areas, for move and resize. Then I can keep resize in WindowFrame and keep move in TitleBar.

Get rid of the GUIManager mouseUp hack when I ensure resize/move using non client areas work

Prevent docking if available size is less than 20 pixels, otherwise there might be some weirdness

GUIViewport:
 - TODO - GUIViewport updateRenderElementsInternal only gets called when contents change, but viewport should update even if 
    only its offset changes (normally that just marks the mesh as modified, which doesn't result in a call to updateRenderElementsInternal)
	- UPDATE: I don't use GUIViewport anymore

Other things to remember:
 - Possibly add a way to have hidden widgets in the EditorWidgetContainer (like side-bars that pop on mouse over in Visual Studio)
 - A way to persist window states
 - Also a way to reset all widgets to original locations
