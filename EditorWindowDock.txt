Add icons to drag and drop - There's a built-in windows icon for this. I think. Although solution that accepts custom cursors is probably better longterm. (Special class BuiltinCursors?)
 - Drag and drop manager currently ignores the provided icon, but it should use it as a cursor

Add highlight to WindowMover so I can know when I'm mousing over it with a dragged window in hand
Ensure that dropping a window onto a mover will actually docks it properly

GUIManager only changes mouse over events in MouseMove method, but that method doesn't get called when mouse leaves the window!

I still have the issue where GUIManager hack code got triggered
Get rid of the GUIManager mouseUp hack when I ensure resize/move using non client areas work

Prevent docking if available size is less than 20 pixels, otherwise there might be some weirdness

Possible solution to MouseUp problem:
  on WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE call OIS and SetCooperativeLevel(BACKGROUND)
  and on WM_EXITSIZEMOVE revert back to FOREGROUND coop level

And for MouseMove problem:
  Track mouse leave events, add a handler to Platform and hook up GUIManager to it

------------------------

Other things to remember:
 - Possibly add a way to have hidden widgets in the EditorWidgetContainer (like side-bars that pop on mouse over in Visual Studio)
 - A way to persist window states
 - Also a way to reset all widgets to original locations

Will destroying a GUIWidget properly schedule destruction? (i.e. so it won't be destroyed mid-frame)
 - I will probably need to add deferred destroy to Components and SceneObjects as well

GUIViewport:
 - TODO - GUIViewport updateRenderElementsInternal only gets called when contents change, but viewport should update even if 
    only its offset changes (normally that just marks the mesh as modified, which doesn't result in a call to updateRenderElementsInternal)
	- UPDATE: I don't use GUIViewport anymore
