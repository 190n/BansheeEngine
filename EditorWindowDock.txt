TODO:
 - Dock manager currently eats all mouse input. Modify GUIManager so it will recursively try to send input to all elements under the cursor until one processes it

Resize sliders
 - Add a button between docked windows
 - Allow the button to be dragged, and it will automatically resize separating widgets

TitleBar dock/undock 
 - Moving the dragged window over a title bar will temporarily dock the title bar and allow you to move it (as in first step)
   - If you release the mouse the window will then be permanently docked at that location

Polish TOOD:
 - Change cursor icon when window is dragged
 - Prevent docking if available size is less than 20 pixels, otherwise there might be some weirdness

------------------------

Other things to remember:
 - Possibly add a way to have hidden widgets in the EditorWidgetContainer (like side-bars that pop on mouse over in Visual Studio)
 - A way to persist window states
 - Also a way to reset all widgets to original locations
