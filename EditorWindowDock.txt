TODO:
 - Closing all docked widgets causes an exception
 - Test out minimum dock container size and maybe increase it a bit

Polish TOOD:
 - Change cursor icon when window is dragged
 - Prevent docking if available size is less than 20 pixels, otherwise there might be some weirdness

------------------------
Layout saving/loading:
TODO:
 EditorWindow creation from Scripts is currently disabled as I need to export EditorWidget classes
   - I will probably want to move BansheeEditor stuff into its own BansheeEditor .dll (need it for singleton instantiation as well)
 Register a bunch of duplicate widgets and open and dock them
 C# EditorWindows

------------------------

Other things to remember:
 - Possibly add a way to have hidden widgets in the EditorWidgetContainer (like side-bars that pop on mouse over in Visual Studio)
