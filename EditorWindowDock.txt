TODO:
 - Add GUIElementContainer, a class that does no rendering but contains other GUIElements. Use it for GUIScrolArea, GUITabbedTitleBar and GUIDockManager
 - DO NOT make EditorWidgetContainer a GUIElement. Instead refactor _updateLayoutInternal in GUITabbedTitleBar into "updateLayout" and make it do all the work EditorWidgetContainer does now
 - Docking/Undocking elements will cause an exception. Happened after TabbedTitleBar refactor
 - When I dock two windows (maybe even just one?) and drag the title bar, layout seems to get messed up
 - Ensure that dragging items onto the title bar works

Resize sliders
 - Add a button between docked windows
 - Allow the button to be dragged, and it will automatically resize separating widgets

TitleBar dock/undock 
 - Releasing the dragged window over the drop overlay will dock the window
 - Moving the dragged window over a title bar will temporarily dock the title bar and allow you to move it (as in first step)
   - If you release the mouse the window will then be permanently docked at that location

CONSIDER getting rid of mouse event filters for DockManager
 - I can probably convert DockManager into a GUIElement?
   - EditorWidgetContainer as well!
      - Make sure to update GUITabbedTitleBar::tabDragEnd when I do convert it to GUIElement

Polish TOOD:
 - Change cursor icon when window is dragged
 - Prevent docking if available size is less than 20 pixels, otherwise there might be some weirdness

------------------------

Other things to remember:
 - Possibly add a way to have hidden widgets in the EditorWidgetContainer (like side-bars that pop on mouse over in Visual Studio)
 - A way to persist window states
 - Also a way to reset all widgets to original locations
