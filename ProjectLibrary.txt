
 ProjectLibrary
  - Save/Load - saves/loads the hierarchy of ResourceEntries

--------------------

Imported resources should get queued. Since I want to display a progress bar with % of resources imported.
 - Plus importers should work on separate threads (Will likely make Resources worker threads global and re-use them for importer)

-------------------

TOMORROW:
mIsVisible seems to get set in updateTreeElement? Which means expanding/closing wont work without it
 - I should probably move those so they are changed whenever mIsExpanded is toggled
 - I might want to move stuff from TreeView::update in general to an event-based system. Only in case of Scene those events would be generated internally.

Later: Projectlibrary add (tracking drag and drop using Win32DragAndDropManager)
-------------------

LOW PRIORITY

ResourceManifest contains absolute file locations. What happens when the project moves?
 - When saving ResourceManifest make sure to process all paths and make them relative.
 - Then reverse that process on load

What happens when importer fails importing a file?
 - This can be one of the lasts steps, but I will likely need to go through all importers manually and set them up so they return proper error codes
    and clean up properly on error.
	- In fact they should use exceptions but those should be translated to error codes when returned to Importer
	  - OR just write directly to debug log?
	   - Probably log and error code, since I will need to inform the outside world that import failed somehow
