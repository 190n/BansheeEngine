 - ResourceManifest filePathToUUID wont work as intended as file-path comparison is case sensitive plus it wont deal with slashes properly
 - Remove WPath. In general, but specifically from CmPath.h, CmFileSystem.h and Projectlibrary
 - ResourceTreeView - Element sorting doesn't work
 - ProjectLibrary Save/Load - saves/loads the hierarchy of ResourceEntries
    - ResourceManifest needs to store relative locations when I save it, so that user can move Project folder safely
 - Resource import queue (ability to display progress bar for resources that are importing)
 - Implement Delete command for ResourceTreeView

--------------------

Test:
 - OSDropTarget
    - Drag and drop one file from Explorer into TreeView
    - Drag and drop multiple files from Explorer into TreeView
    - Drag and drop entire folders from Explorer into TreeView
    - Dragging folders or files from within Resources to another sub-folder in Resources

 - File monitoring
    - Add a file and ensure it is imported
    - Delete a file and ensure it has been cleaned up
    - Add a whole folder hierarchy with files and see if it is constructed properly
    - Delete a folder hierarcha and ensure it has been cleaned up

 - Start-up
     - Load up ProjectLibrary with a complex hierarchy already existing, with multiple files to import

 - Save/Load (After it is implemented)
     - Ensure that leaving application and then reloading will still recognize previously saved assets and will not reimport them
       - Also ensure that UUIDs will be properly read from .meta files

LOW PRIORITY

What happens when importer fails importing a file?
 - This can be one of the lasts steps, but I will likely need to go through all importers manually and set them up so they return proper error codes
    and clean up properly on error.
	- In fact they should use exceptions but those should be translated to error codes when returned to Importer
	  - OR just write directly to debug log?
	   - Probably log and error code, since I will need to inform the outside world that import failed somehow
