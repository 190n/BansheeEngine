 - Moving files within the TreeView will still cause them to be reimported
  - UUIDs in meta files dont seem to match.
  - I need a way to import a resource while keeping the existing UUID (maybe reimport() method?)
 - ResourceManifest filePathToUUID wont work as intended as file-path comparison is case sensitive plus it wont deal with slashes properly
 - ProjectLibrary Save/Load - saves/loads the hierarchy of ResourceEntries
    - ResourceManifest needs to store relative locations when I save it, so that user can move Project folder safely
 - Resource import queue (ability to display progress bar for resources that are importing)
 - Implement Delete command for ResourceTreeView

--------------------

Test:
 - File monitoring
    - Delete a file and ensure it has been cleaned up
    - Delete a folder hierarcha and ensure it has been cleaned up

 - Save/Load (After it is implemented)
     - Ensure that leaving application and then reloading will still recognize previously saved assets and will not reimport them
       - Also ensure that UUIDs will be properly read from .meta files

LOW PRIORITY

What happens when importer fails importing a file?
 - This can be one of the lasts steps, but I will likely need to go through all importers manually and set them up so they return proper error codes
    and clean up properly on error.
	- In fact they should use exceptions but those should be translated to error codes when returned to Importer
	  - OR just write directly to debug log?
	   - Probably log and error code, since I will need to inform the outside world that import failed somehow
