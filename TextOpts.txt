Make sure to also update TextSprite and ImageSprite and anything else in UpdateMesh, then don't forget to find the issue that causes elements to get marked as dirty every single frame

Profiler does a lot of allocations of its own which can seriously skew the profiling results. Try to eliminate them all or add alloc/free overhead fields

When optimizing UpdateLayout make sure to mark elements that are fully culled as Culled
 - But in order to determine that I first need to update the sprite to find out the elements bounds which defeats the point
 - TODO - FIgure this out

TODO: TextData does an extra mem alloc in this bit of code: PageBuffer[NextFreePageInfo].texture = HTexture();, try to avoid it
