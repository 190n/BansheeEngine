 REFACTOR GpuProgram
  - Get rid of HighLevelGpuProgram and merge everything into GpuProgram if possible
  - Right now HighLevelGpuProgram always creates just one instance of GpuProgram internally, and I don't see why they should be separate
  - Possibly also determine how to neatly handle compilation faliure. Error should be reported and dummy shader should be returned.

code for example parameters when creating one.
