Events:
 - Add support for variadic number of parameters. Initially just by using boost preprocessor like in other places.
  - Note for events and its function style arguments: "class variadic_extended_signature<R (Args...)>"

Temporarily make filesystem use VS filesystem header

--------------
Once ported to VS:
 - Remove boost preprocessor macros and use variadic templates
 - Remove ::type extensions from vectors
 - Port filesystem from VS implementation to custom one

--------------
Other:
 - std::function allocates memory yet I'm not using a custom allocator for it. Replace std::function with custom Function method.
 - Ability to construct Module using startUp without having to do allocation outside of it


 REFACTOR GpuProgram
  - Get rid of HighLevelGpuProgram and merge everything into GpuProgram if possible
  - Right now HighLevelGpuProgram always creates just one instance of GpuProgram internally, and I don't see why they should be separate
  - Possibly also determine how to neatly handle compilation faliure. Error should be reported and dummy shader should be returned.
