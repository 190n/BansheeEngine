 - Ability to construct Module using startUp without having to do allocation outside of it

DEBUG CODE in GLRenderSystem::beginDraw()

		GLuint VAOID[1];
		glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAOID[0]);
		glBindVertexArray(VAOID[0]);

I'll probably want a system like PipelineManager where it saves all VS and VB combinations and retuns vertex array for it.
 - Those vertex arrays should probably be saved in the vertex shader

Each VertexDeclaration needs unique ID. 
 - Attempt to make vertex declarations immutable. Once created they get a unique ID.
 - Do the same for vertex buffers and vertex shaders
 - Remove hash from vertex declaration and replace it with ID, also fix the comparison functions because
   in DX11 finding input layout will involve going over every single element in the declaration since it's
   stored in an unordered map.

Create a proper git repo of dependencies folder

Shutdown issues (can't repro atm but they're there):
Destroying area sometimes fails
 - I'm guessing that is because EditorWindows get closed and destroyed before scripts are unloaded. All areas and GUI elements are destroyed with them.
  - I should try to manually destroy C# editor windows before main window is closed

Native instance is sometimes null when delete is called
