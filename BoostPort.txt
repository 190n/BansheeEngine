 - std::function allocates memory yet I'm not using a custom allocator for it. Replace std::function with custom Function method.
 - Ability to construct Module using startUp without having to do allocation outside of it

 REFACTOR GpuProgram
  - Get rid of HighLevelGpuProgram and merge everything into GpuProgram if possible
  - Right now HighLevelGpuProgram always creates just one instance of GpuProgram internally, and I don't see why they should be separate
  - Possibly also determine how to neatly handle compilation faliure. Error should be reported and dummy shader should be returned.

cm_shared_ptr should use && for parameter forwarding?
cm_core_ptr too

Refactor GLRenderSystem:
createRenderSystemCapabilities
initialiseFromRenderSystemCapabilities
initializeContext
switchContext
oneTimeContextInitialization
