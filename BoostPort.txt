 - Ability to construct Module using startUp without having to do allocation outside of it

DEBUG CODE in GLRenderSystem::beginDraw()

		GLuint VAOID[1];
		glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAOID[0]);
		glBindVertexArray(VAOID[0]);

I'll probably want a system like PipelineManager where it saves all VS and VB combinations and retuns vertex array for it.
 - Those vertex arrays should probably be saved in the vertex shader
