 - Ability to construct Module using startUp without having to do allocation outside of it

DEBUG CODE in GLRenderSystem::beginDraw()

		GLuint VAOID[1];
		glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAOID[0]);
		glBindVertexArray(VAOID[0]);

I'll probably want a system like PipelineManager where it saves all VS and VB combinations and retuns vertex array for it.
 - Those vertex arrays should probably be saved in the vertex shader

Create a proper git repo of dependencies folder

Shutdown issues (can't repro atm but they're there):
Destroying area sometimes fails
 - I'm guessing that is because EditorWindows get closed and destroyed before scripts are unloaded. All areas and GUI elements are destroyed with them.
  - I should try to manually destroy C# editor windows before main window is closed

Native instance is sometimes null when delete is called
